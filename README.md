# Sandbox-for-S&P-Stocks
• Built an intuitive interface with Streamlit sliders to tweak model hyperparameters (sequence length, LSTM units, dropout, threshold) and instantly observe how each change impacts performance

• Overlaid weekly closing prices with green/red markers showing correct vs. incorrect predictions—no tables required, just an at‑a‑glance view of where the model succeeds or fails

• Integrated live metrics (precision, recall, accuracy), confusion matrix, and training history charts so users can understand the model’s strengths, spot weaknesses, and decide when—and when not—to trust its signals

• Enabled users to select any historical date range to test and visualize model behavior during different market regimes (e.g., crises, bull runs)

• Tools & Skills: Streamlit, TensorFlow/Keras, time series modeling, interactive dashboard design, user-centered UX for ML, model interpretability, visual storytelling, hands-on deep learning experimentation
